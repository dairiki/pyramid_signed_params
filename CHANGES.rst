==========================

- Add support for Pyramid 2.0.
- Mark this as a stable release.

Release 0.1b5 (2018-03-08)
==========================

- Use the new in ``PyJWT`` 1.6 more specific ``InvalidSignatureError``
  in favor of the generic ``DecodeError`` to detect invalid signatures
  (when available.)

-----

- Test under both ``PyJWT`` 1.6 and 1.5.3.

- Fix for changes in default log level in ``pytest`` 3.4.

Release 0.1b2 (2017-11-16)
==========================

- Change the ``signed_params`` reified request method so that it
  catches ``UnicodeDecodeError``\s when accessing ``request.params``,
  and returns an empty dict.  (If the parameters are not properly
  encoded, there are no valid signed parameters.)

Release 0.1b1 (2017-11-16)
==========================

- Drop support for python 2.6.  Test under python 3.6.

Security
--------

- Explicitly specify allowed algorithms when decoding JWTs.

Release 0.1a5 (2016-11-13)
==========================

- Remove the (broken) config-time warning issued if no service is
  registered for ``ISignedParamsService``.  (When ``autocommit`` was
  off, this warning was always being issued.)

Release 0.1a4 (2016-11-02)
==========================

- The setting for configuring the JWT signing secret(s) has been
  renamed to ``pyramid_signed_param.secret`` from
  ``pyramid_signed_param.secrets``.  Basic usage involve only a single
  secret. (Two allow for rotation of secrets, any configured secrets are
  accepted when verifying signatures, but only the first is used for
  creating new signatures.)

- ``Pyramid_signed_params.include`` now issues a warning if the
  ``ISignedParamsService`` is not configured.

- ``JWTSecretProviderFactory`` now raises a ``ConfigurationError``
  if no secrets are found in the app ``settings``.


Release 0.1a3 (2016-11-02)
==========================

Initial release.
